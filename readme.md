# Proxy Hypixel

## Overview

Proxy Hypixel is a Minecraft mod that allows you to connect to the Hypixel server through a proxy. This can be useful for:

*   Bypassing Network Restrictions: If your network blocks direct access to Hypixel, a proxy can help you circumvent these restrictions.
*   Improving Connection Stability: In some cases, a proxy can provide a more stable connection to the Hypixel server.
*   Enhanced Privacy: Using a proxy can add an extra layer of privacy to your connection.

## Features

*   Proxy Support: Connect to Hypixel through an HTTP proxy.
*   Configurable Settings: Easily configure your proxy settings within the game.
*   Proxy Type: Supports HTTP proxy type.
*   Authentication: Supports proxy servers that require username and password authentication.
*   Easy to use: The mod is easy to use and configure.

## Configuration

The mod's configuration can be accessed in-game. You can configure the following settings:

*   Proxy Enabled: Toggle the use of a proxy on or off.
*   Proxy Address: The address of your proxy server (e.g., `proxy.example.com:8080`).
*   Proxy Username: The username for proxy authentication (if required).
*   Proxy Password: The password for proxy authentication (if required).
*   Proxy Type: The type of proxy to use (currently only HTTP is supported).
